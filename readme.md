## Notes

The documentation and qa/qc varies from project-to-project in this repository.

Some projects are well documented, some are very light and are only intended 
to demonstrate a proof of concept, whereas some are at intial development and are
akin to scratch code.  Buyer beware, but remember it is all free :)

Several projects presented here were inspired by code challenges introduced in 
textbooks and online tutorials which are cited in the 
[Resources](#Resources) section below.
